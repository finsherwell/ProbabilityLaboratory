# Probability Laboratory

A curated collection of Jupyter notebooks that computationally demonstrate the core ideas of probability theory.
The goal is not formal proof-first probability, but intuition which is built on simulation, visualisation and experimentation.
This repository is designed to complement traditional textbooks and courses by turning abstract concepts into executable objects.

## Scope and Philosophy

- Focus on first-principles probability (definition, process, applications)
- Heavy use of Monte Carlo simulation
- Emphasis on why results work, not just what they are
- Minimal reliance on black-box statistical libraries
- Mathematical equations will appear throughout

## Notebook Organisation

1. Combinatorics
   Foundations of counting, which probability rests on.
2. Probability Basics:
   The mechanics of probability itself.
3. Expectation and Random Variabls
   Probability meets numerical outcomes.
4. Probability Distributions
   Canonical distributions and why they matter.
5. Gaussian Approximation
   Why the normal distribution appears everywhere.
6. Correlation and Regression
   Quantifying relationships between variables.
7. Joint Distributions
   Multiple random variables at once.
8. Inequalities and the Central Limit Theorem
   Why averages stabilise.
9. Statistical Testing
   Probability as a decision tool.
10. Markov Chains
    Probability with memory.

### Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a Python virtual environment
3. Install the required rependencies using `requirements.txt`

### Intended Audience

- Students learning probability for the first time
- Engineers and scientists who want intuition, not just the formulas
- Anyone who learns best by running the maths
- Myself
  Some calculus and basic Python are assumed. Everything else is built from the ground up.
